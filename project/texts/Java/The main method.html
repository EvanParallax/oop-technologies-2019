<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b><i></i></b><i></i>The declaration of the main method</h2><p>Java is primary an object-oriented language. It means a Java program can be considered as a collection of objects that communicate via calling each other's methods. A typical Java program includes a lot of classes, interfaces, objects and other concepts from the object-oriented programming.</p><p>Even the simplest "procedural-style" program should have at least one class and the main method inside to start the program. The main method is the entry point for any applications. Ever since Java 7 there has been no other way to start an application without this method (excluding the case when you start your application inside a special container for applications but it is not considered in this course). </p><p>Let's see an example of the simplest application that prints the text <b>"Hello, Java"</b> in the standard output:<br></p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java");
    }
}</code></pre><p>Here is a class named <code class="java">Main</code>. The class contains <b>the main method</b> for starting the program.</p><p>It is important to mention that a class containing the main method can have any name, but the main method should always have the same name. </p><p>Let's take a closer look at the declaration of the main method:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args)</code></pre><div><ul><li>the keyword <code class="java">public</code> indicates that the method can be invoked from everywhere;</li><li>the keyword <code class="java">static</code> indicates the method can be invoked without creating an instance of the class;</li><li>the keyword <code class="java">void</code> indicates the method doesn't return any value;</li><li>the array variable <code class="java">args </code>contains arguments entered at the command line if no arguments the array is empty.</li></ul><p>As you can see, even the simplest Java application contains a lot of concepts. All of them will be studied in the next topics related to methods and the object-oriented programming. Now you should just understand how to write and run a simple java program with <b>the main method</b>.</p></div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><b></b>Invalid declarations of the main method<br></h2><p>If the main method has an invalid declaration, two cases are possible:</p><ul><li>your program cannot be compiled</li><li>your program is successfully compiled but can't be started</li></ul><p><b>Your program cannot be compiled.</b> It is a case when the main method declaration breaks the syntax of Java.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>invalid method declaration: no returning value (even <code class="java">void</code>).<br></li></ul><pre><code class="language-java">public static main(String[] args)</code></pre><ul><li>invalid method declaration: a mistake in the keyword (<code class="java">pubic</code> instead of <code class="java">public</code>).<br></li></ul><pre><code class="language-java">pubic static void main(String[] args)</code></pre><p><b>A program can be compiled but cannot be run.</b> It is a case when the main method has a correct declaration as a regular method but doesn't satisfy the specific requirement of the main method.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>invalid arguments (should be <code class="java">String[] args</code>)<br></li></ul><pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java");
}</code></pre><ul><li>the method declaration has no the keyword <code class="java">static</code></li></ul><pre><code class="language-java">public void main(String args) { 
    System.out.println("Hello, Java");
} </code></pre><p>In both cases, an error happens at runtime.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p><b></b>So, the main method is the entry point of any Java programs. It has a very specific syntax which you need to remember.<b></b></p>
