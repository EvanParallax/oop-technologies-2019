<h2 style="text-align: center;">Computers and programming</h2>

<p>Today, computers are everywhere: smartphones in our pockets, notebooks, and PCs in offices and at home, servers in large data centers, control systems of cars and planes. Computers consist of different hardware and are operated by different operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, and others. We will use the term “<strong>platform</strong>” to refer to the combination of hardware and software that makes up a computer.</p>

<p>To make computers solve our problems, various <strong>programs</strong> are created; they represent sequences of instructions for performing a specific task. In order to create these programs, programmers write instructions in various programming languages. These languages are more restrictive than a natural language, but they allow us to explain precisely what we want from computers without any ambiguity.</p>

<p>Some programming languages are built for web / mobile / system programming while other languages are used for solving challenges in various domains.</p>

<p>Among the <strong>key requirements</strong> for modern programming languages are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A possibility of rapid software development;</li>
	<li>A good performance of developed programs;</li>
	<li>A possibility of creating complex software systems;</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>One of the most popular programming languages and one that meets all of these requirements is <strong>Java</strong>. We will give you an overview of this language.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">What is Java?</h2>

<p><strong>Java </strong>is a general-purpose, modern programming language initially developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sun Microsystems</a>, and currently owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a>. The key feature of the language is <strong>platform independence</strong>: it means that the same Java program can be run on multiple platforms without any changes! This principle is also known as "write once, run anywhere" (or WORA).</p>

<p>Note, a <strong>platform</strong> is a combination of computer hardware and software.</p>

<p>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years. It has earned the top position in the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/﻿" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TIOBE</a> index (a programming language popularity index). This language is used by a huge community of developers around the world! If you have a problem, you can always ask other developers or find a suitable answer online.</p>

<p>Java is used in our <strong>Android</strong> smartphones, the financial services industry, telecommunications, embedded systems and in many other areas. Medical applications use it to store patient data, computer games such as Minecraft are created using Java; development tools like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse wouldn't exist without it.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A short history of Java</h2>

<p>The Java language project was initiated in 1991 by James Gosling and his colleagues. In the beginning, the language was called "Oak." Later the project was renamed "Java," a reference to Java coffee. For this reason, the language’s logo is a cup of coffee.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Sun Microsystems released Java 1.0 in 1995. After that, new versions were released every 1 to 3 years. Since Java 9, released in 2017, new versions have been released every 6 months. You can read more about its history and find the most recent version <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Some important features of Java</h2>

<p>As you already know, the most important feature of Java is <strong>platform independence</strong>.</p>

<p>Another important feature is a <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>clear syntax</strong>. Many elements of the language are easy to read and are widely used in other programming languages such as C/C++, C#, JavaScript, and Go.</p>

<p>If you have ever written programs in C/C++, then you know that manual memory cleaning can lead to bugs in the code. Fortunately, Java has a <strong>garbage collector</strong> that automatically cleans memory from unused objects during runtime.</p>

<p>It is also important that Java supports multiple programming paradigms that you will learn during this course. Java is primarily an imperative language based on the object-oriented concept: almost every part of a program is an object. Therefore, a program itself can be considered a set of interacting objects. Also, it partially supports modern programming paradigms such as <em>generic programming, concurrent programming, functional programming</em> (starting with Java 8), and some others.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Java is a modern and popular programming language that can be successfully used in almost all domains.</p>
