<h2 style="text-align: center;">Literals</h2>

<p>Regardless of its complexity, a program always performs operations on numbers, strings, and other values. These values are called <strong>literals</strong>. There are many different sorts of literals in Java but in this topic, we will focus only on a few of them: the ones that surround us all the time in everyday life.</p>

<p>Let's consider integer numbers, strings and characters in the format in which they are written in Java.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Integer numbers</h2>

<p>These numbers are used to count things in the real world. Also, we will often use them in Java.</p>

<p>Here are several examples of valid integer number literals separated by commas: <code>0, 1, 2, 10, 11, 100</code>.</p>

<p>If an integer value contains a lot of digits, we can add underscores to divide the digit into blocks for increased readability: <code>1_000_000</code>. It's more readable than the same value written like <code>1000000</code>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Characters</h2>

<p>A single character can represent a digit, a letter or another symbol. In order to write a character we use single quotes as follows: <code>'A', 'B', 'C', 'x', 'y', 'z', '0', '1', '2', '9'</code>. Character literals can represent symbols of an alphabet, digits from <code>'0'</code> to <code>'9'</code>, whitespaces (<code>' '</code>), or other characters or symbols (<code>'$'</code>).</p>

<p>Do not confuse characters that represent numbers (e.g. <code>'9'</code>), with numbers themselves (e.g. <code>9</code>).</p>

<p>A character can't include two and more digits or letters because it represents only a single symbol. The following two examples are <strong>incorrect</strong>: <code>'abc', '543'</code>. These literals contain too many characters.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Strings</h2>

<p>A string is a sequence of any individual characters. Strings represent text information such as a text of advertising, an address of a web page or a login from a site. </p>

<p>In order to write a string we use double quotes instead of single ones. Here are some valid examples: <code>"text", "I want to know Java", "123456", "e-mail@gmail.com"</code>. Note, <code>"A"</code> is also a valid string, but do not confuse it with a character <code>'A'</code>.</p>

<p>As you can see, strings can include letters, digits, whitespaces and other characters.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Remember</h2>

<p>Do not confuse these literals:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>123</code> is an integer number, <code>"123"</code> is a string;</li>
	<li><code>'A'</code> is a character, <code>"A"</code> is a string;</li>
	<li><code>'1'</code> is a character, <code>1</code> is an integer number.</li>
</ul>
