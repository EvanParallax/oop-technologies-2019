<h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a variable?</h2><div>A variable is <b></b>placeholder for storing a value<b></b> like a string, a number, or something else. Every variable has a <b>name (or identifier)</b> to distinguish it from other variables. It is possible to access a value by its variable's name.</div><div><br></div><div>Variables are one of the most often used elements of programs; therefore it is important to understand and be able to use them.</div><div><br></div><div><h2 style="text-align: center;">Declaring variables <br></h2><p>Before you start using a variable, you must declare it. To declare a variable, Kotlin provides two keywords:</p><ul><li><code class="kotlin">val</code> (from <i>value</i>) — declares an <b>immutable variable</b> (just a <b>named value</b> or <b>constant</b>) that cannot be changed after it has been initialized;<br></li><li><code class="kotlin">var</code> (from <i>variable</i>) — declares a <b>mutable variable</b> that can be changed (as many times as needed);<br></li></ul><p>When you declare a variable, <b></b>you must add its<b></b> name after one of these keywords. The name of a variable cannot start with a digit. Usually, it starts with a letter. Always try to choose meaningful and readable names for variables to make your code easy to understand.</p><p>To assign a certain value to a variable, we should use the assignment operator <code>=</code>.<br></p><p>Let's declare an immutable variable named <code>language</code> and initialize it with the string <code>"Kotlin"</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val language = "Kotlin"</code></pre><div><b>Note </b>that<b></b> the case of a variable is important: <code>language</code> is not the same as <code>Language</code>.</div><br>Now we can access this string by the variable's name. Let's print it!<br><pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(language) // prints "Kotlin" without quotes</code></pre><div></div><div>This variable cannot be changed after it has been initialized because it has been declared with <code>val</code>.<br></div></div><div><br></div><div>Let's declare a mutable variable named <code>dayOfWeek</code> and print its value before and after changing it.</div><div><br></div><div><pre><code class="language-kotlin">var dayOfWeek = "Monday"
println(dayOfWeek) // Monday

dayOfWeek = "Tuesday"
println(dayOfWeek) // Tuesday</code></pre> </div><div></div><div>In the example above, we declared a variable named <code>dayOfWeek</code> and initialized it with the value <code>"Monday"</code>. Then we accessed the value by the variable name to print it. After that, we changed the variable's value to <code>"Tuesday"</code> and printed this new value.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Note </b>that<b> </b>you do not need to declare a variable again to change its value. Just assign a new value to it using the <code>=</code> operator.</div><div><br></div><div>It is also possible to declare and initialize a variable with the value of another one:</div><div><br></div><div><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val cost = 3
val costOfCoffee = cost
println(costOfCoffee) // 3</code></pre></div><div>Variables can store not only strings, but also numbers, characters, and other data types, which we will learn about in this course.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Let's declare three immutable variables to store a number, a string, and a character, and then print their values.</div><div><br></div><div><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val ten = 10
val greeting = "Hello"
val firstLetter = 'A'

println(ten) // 10
println(greeting) // Hello
println(firstLetter) // A</code></pre></div><div>There is one restriction for mutable variables (which are declared with the keyword <code>var</code>). You can only reassign values of the same type as the initial value. So, the following code is not correct:</div><div><br></div><div><pre><code class="language-kotlin">var number = 10
number = 11 // ok
number = "twelve" // an error here!</code></pre><div></div><div>Please remember this restriction!</div></div><div><br></div><div><h2 style="text-align: center;">Battle of keywords: val vs var</h2><div>As you saw above, there are two keywords which can be used to declare variables. Actually, in many cases, it is better to use immutable variables declared with the keyword <code>val</code>. Before using <code>var</code> you should be sure that <code>val</code> is not suitable in that case. If it isn't, then use <code>var</code>. But keep in mind, the more mutable variables in your program, the harder it will be to understand it. By the same token, immutable variables make your program easier and help to maintain a readable code. So, use <code>val</code> whenever possible! You can easily replace it with <code>var</code> when it becomes necessary.</div></div>
