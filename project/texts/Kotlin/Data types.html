<h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a data type?</h2><p>From your life experience, you probably know that a number is not the same as a text. For example, you can perform arithmetic operations (such as multiplication) on numbers, but not on texts. Kotlin also knows it. Every variable has a <b>type</b> that determines possible operations and which values can be stored in it.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Variable types</h2><p>A variable's type is set 

<b></b>when it is declared<b></b>:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val text = "Hello, I am studying Kotlin now."
val n = 1</code></pre><p>In this case, Kotlin knows that <code>text</code> is a string, and <code>n</code> is a number. Kotlin determines the types of both variables automatically. This mechanism is called <b>type inference</b>.</p><p>The form of a declaration with type inference looks like this:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val/var identifier = initialization</code></pre><p>It is possible to specify the type of a variable when declaring it:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val/var identifier: Type = initialization </code></pre><div><br></div><div><p><b>Note,</b> the name of a type always starts with an uppercase letter.</p>Let's declare the same variables while also specifying their types:<br></div><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val text: String = "Hello, I am studying Kotlin now."
val n: Int = 1</code></pre><p>The <code>Int</code> type means the variable stores an integer number (<code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, ..., <code>100_000_000</code>, ...). The <code>String</code> type means the variable stores a string (<code>"Hello"</code>, <code>"John Smith"</code>). You will learn about these and other data types in the following lessons.</p><p>You will see both of these forms used in practice. The form that uses type inference makes your code more concise and readable, but in some cases, it may be better to specify the type. For example, if we would like to declare a variable and initialize it later, the form with type inference will not work at all.</p><div><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val greeting // error
greeting = "hello"</code></pre> <br></div><div>The code above is incorrect, because Kotlin cannot infer the type of the variable when it is merely declared, and every variable must have a type. The code below works well because the type is specified by the programmer:</div><div><br></div><div><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val greeting: String // ok
greeting = "hello"</code></pre></div><h2 style="text-align: center;">Type mismatch</h2><p>One of the most important 

<b></b>functions of<b></b>
data types is to protect you from assigning an unsuitable value to a variable. For example, the following code will not work:<br></p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val n: Int = "abc" // Type mismatch: inferred type is String but Int was expected</code></pre><br>So, if you see a <b>type mismatch</b> error, it means you've assigned something unsuitable to a variable.The same problem occurs when you try to assign an unsuitable value to mutable variable declared using the type inference.<div><br></div><div><pre><code class="language-kotlin">var age = 30 // the type is inferred as Int
age = "31 years old" // Type mismatch</code></pre><p>In the following lessons, we will learn about the other data types and some possible problems with them.</p></div>
