<p>When programmers implement an object-oriented program, they often use already defined classes to build the program logic. For example, an object of the <code>Scanner</code> class allows you to get the next word in the console input, and this word is an object of the <code>String</code> class. But also programmers frequently need to declare some program-specific classes. In this topic, we will discuss ways how to create your own simple class and how to use it.</p>

<h2>Declaring new classes</h2>

<p>In order to declare a new class, you should write the <code>class</code> keyword and the <strong>class name</strong> following it. To start, let's declare a class named <code>Emptiness</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Emptiness {
    // empty body
}</code></pre>

<p>In Kotlin, when a class has an <strong>empty body</strong>, <strong>curly braces</strong> can be <strong>omitted</strong>. So the same class definition is the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Emptiness</code></pre>

<p>Classes can be declared in <code>.kt</code> files. Usually, they are declared at the top level of a file but nothing forbids you to declare them in other places, e.g. inside the function.</p>

<h2>Object creation</h2>

<p>What's the purpose of declaring a class? Briefly, each defined <strong>class</strong> introduces a <strong>new type</strong>. So you can create objects of a class and store them as variables and values. Sometimes standard types are insufficient so that opportunity is handy. There will be a few examples to make it clearer.</p>

<p>To create an instance of a class, simply write the <strong>class name</strong> and <strong>empty parentheses</strong>. In other words, the syntax is the same as the one for calling a function. As an example, let's do that for the <code>Emptiness</code> class:</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val empty: Emptiness = Emptiness()</code></pre>

<p>We have just assigned a new object of the <code>Emptiness</code> class to the <code>empty</code> variable. The variable has the <code>Emptiness</code> type so you can't reassign an object of any other type to it. As a general rule in Kotlin the explicit type directive can be omitted:</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val empty = Emptiness()</code></pre>

<h2>Class member</h2>

<p>A class body can include <strong>class members</strong>. For now, we will talk only about <strong>properties</strong> that replace <strong>fields</strong> in Kotlin: they can <strong>store data</strong> too. Other advantages of properties and other class members will be discussed in the next topics.</p>

<p>Note that all class members are optional. For example, the <code>Emptiness</code> class has no properties.</p>

<h2>Writing properties</h2>

<p>Properties are pretty similar to variables and values. If you want to assign values to a property during runtime, you declare it as a <code>var</code>, otherwise, a <code>val</code> is your choice.</p>

<p>Also, a property has a strict type. The type can be any. It can be a standard type like a number or a string or a custom type. So a property type can be your own class and even the same class where the property is declared.</p>

<p>A property that just stores data must somehow receive an <strong>initial value</strong>. For example, the property can be set in the class body.</p>

<p>A class can have as many properties as you need.</p>

<p>Now let's declare a class for representing a patient in a hospital information system:</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Patient {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
    var age: Int = 0
    var height: Double = 0.0
}</code></pre>

<p>Here we see that the <code>Patient</code> class has three properties that can be reassigned: name, age, and height.</p>

<p>Each object of the class has the <strong>same set of fields</strong>, but the <strong>values</strong> of the fields <strong>can differ</strong> from object to object.</p>

<h2>Accessing properties</h2>

<p>Now we will discuss how to get access to object properties. First of all, create an object:</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var patient = Patient()</code></pre>

<p>We haven't changed the object properties yet, so they now have initial values. To get those properties' values, write <strong>a dot and the property name</strong> after the object name:</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(patient.name) // prints "Unknown"
println(patient.age)  // prints "0"</code></pre>

<h2>Changing properties</h2>

<p>Consider the following program. The program creates two patients and sets their properties, then it prints the properties.</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Patient {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
    var age: Int = 0
    var height: Double = 0.0
}

fun main() {
    val john = Patient()
    john.name = "John"
    john.age = 30
    john.height = 180.0

    val alice = Patient()
    alice.name = "Alice"
    alice.age = 22
    alice.height = 165.0

    println("${john.name}: ${john.age} yrs, ${john.height} cm")
    println("${alice.name}: ${alice.age} yrs, ${alice.height} cm")
}</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">John: 30 yrs, 180.0 cm
Alice: 22 yrs, 165.0 cm</code></pre>

<p>Note that when we assign properties of Alice, properties of John remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Also, you should understand that the <code>val</code> before <code>alice</code> means that we can't reassign a <code>Patient</code> to <code>alice</code>. But we can reassign properties of <code>alice</code> because they are marked as <code>var</code>s inside the <code>Patient</code> class.</p>
