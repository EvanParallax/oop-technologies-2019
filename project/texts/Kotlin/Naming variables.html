<h2 style="text-align: center;">Why is naming important?</h2><div>As you may know, every variable has a name that uniquely identifies it among other variables. Giving a good name to a variable may not be as simple as it seems. Experienced programmers put a lot of care much into naming to make their programs easy to understand. It is important because programmers spend a lot of time on reading and understanding code written by other programmers. If variables have bad names, even your own code will seem unclear to you in a few months.<br></div><div><br></div><div>So, always give descriptive and concise names to all variables. As a result, you and other programmers will enjoy your code for a long time.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, there are two sets of rules that restrict the possible names for variables.</div><div><br></div><h2 style="text-align: center;">Rules for naming variables</h2><div>Kotlin has some rules for naming variables<br></div><div><ul><li>names are case-sensitive (the name number is not the same as Number);<br></li><li>a name begins with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits, and underscores  (but <code>_</code>, <code>__</code>, <code>___</code>, ... are not allowed);</li><li>a name cannot start with a digit;<br></li><li>a name must not be a keyword (<code>val</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>fun</code> are illegal names).</li></ul><p>Based on these rules, you may conclude that whitespaces are not allowed in the name of a variable.</p><p><b>It is important </b>that you do not break these rules; otherwise, your program will not work.<br></p><p>Here are some valid names of variables:<br></p><pre><code class="language-java">score, level, fruitType, i, j, abc, _cost, number1</code></pre><p>And here are some invalid ones:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">@pple, 1number, !ab, val, var</code></pre></div><h2 style="text-align: center;">Naming conventions for variables</h2><div>Also, there are conventions for naming variables:<br></div><div><ul><li>if a variable name is a single word it should be in lowercase (for instance: <code class="java">number</code>, <code class="java">value</code>);</li><li>if a variable name includes multiple words it should be in <i></i><code class="java">lowerCamelCase</code><i></i>, i.e. the first word should be in lowercase and each word after the first should have its first letter written in uppercase (for instance: <code class="java">numberOfCoins</code>);</li><li>variable names should not start with <code class="java">_</code>  characters, although it is allowed;</li><li>choose a name that makes sense (for instance: score makes more sense than s, although they are both valid).</li></ul>These conventions are optional, but it is strongly recommended to follow them. <b></b>As we mentioned at the beginning of this lesson,<b></b> they make your code more readable for you and other Kotlin programmers.<br></div>
