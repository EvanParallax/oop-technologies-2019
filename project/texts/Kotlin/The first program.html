<p>In this lesson, we will take a look at your first Kotlin program, which prints <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> This program is traditionally used as the first program to introduce beginner programmers to a programming language. Despite the fact that the program is very simple, it is still a working program and shows the basic syntax of a programming language.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Hello World program</h2>

<p>Here is the source code of this program:</p>
<kotlin-runnable data-highlight-only="undefined" indent="4" theme="idea">
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">
fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {
    println("Hello, World!")
}</code></pre>
</kotlin-runnable>

<p> </p>

<p>To start the program, click the triangle on the right. It outputs <code>"Hello, World"</code>.</p>

<p>If you have already installed the programming environment on your computer, you may run the program locally. If not, do not install it right now. We will learn it further.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The basic terminology</h2>

<p>After you have seen the result, let's learn the basic terminology and then try to understand this program.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>program </strong>—<strong> </strong>a sequence of instructions (called statements), which are executed one after another in a predictable manner. A sequential flow is the most common and straightforward, where statements are executed in the order that they are written, from top to bottom one after the other;</li>
	<li><strong>statement </strong>(or <strong>programming statement</strong>) — a single action (like printing a text);</li>
	<li><strong>block</strong> — a group of zero or more statements enclosed by a pair of braces  <code>{...}</code>; the program above has one block;</li>
	<li><strong>keyword</strong> — a word that has a special meaning in the programming language. Names of keywords are always the same;</li>
	<li><strong>i</strong><strong>dentifier or name</strong> is a word written by a programmer to identify something;</li>
	<li><strong>comment</strong> — a piece of text that is ignored when executing the program, but can help explain a part of the program. It starts with <code>//</code>;</li>
	<li><strong>whitespace</strong> — a blank, tab, or newline; they are used to separate words in the program and improve readability.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Hello World program under a microscope</h2>

<p>The <strong>Hello World</strong> program illustrates the basic elements of any Kotlin program. Right now, we will consider only the most important of them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>The entry point.</strong> The keyword <code>fun</code> defines a function that contains code to be executed. This function has the special name <code>main</code>. It indicates the entry point for a Kotlin program. The function has a body enclosed inside braces <code>{...}</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) { 
    // ...
}</code></pre>

<p>We will discuss the functions later. The name of this function should always be the same: (<code>main</code>). If you name it <code>Main</code> or <code>MAIN</code> or something else, the program will not start.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>The text after <code>//</code> is just a comment, not a part of the program. We will learn about comments in another lesson.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Printing "Hello, World!"</strong> The body of this function consists of programming statements which determine what the program should do after starting. Our program prints the string <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> using the following statement:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">println("Hello, World!")</code></pre>

<p>This is one of the most important things to understand about the <strong>Hello World</strong> program. We invoke the special function <code>println</code> to display the string followed by a new line on the screen. We will often use the same approach to print something.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong> that <code>"Hello, World!"</code> is not a keyword or a name, it is just a string literal to be printed on the screen.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Programs with multiple statements</h2>

<p>As a rule, a program contains multiple statements. Each statement must start from a new line. As an example, the following program has two statements.</p>

<p><kotlin-runnable data-highlight-only="undefined" indent="4" theme="idea"> </kotlin-runnable></p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {
    println("Hello")
    println("World")
}</code></pre>

<p>It displays:</p>

<p> </p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">Hello
World
</code></pre>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have considered the simplest program, which prints <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> It has one function named <code>main</code> which represents the entry point for this program. Don't worry about all those terms (<strong>syntax</strong>, <strong>statement</strong>, <strong>block</strong>) just yet. We will explain them throughout this course. Don’t forget to use the provided program as a template for your own programs.</p>
