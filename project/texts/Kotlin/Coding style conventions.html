<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conventions</h2><p>

<b></b>Perhaps <b></b>

you know that programmers spent a lot of time reading existing code. If a program has unclear code, it is difficult to understand and develop it in the future. So, just a working program 

<b> </b>might not be<b></b>
enough.</p><p>If you have a team consisting of several programmers, it is very important to write readable and standardized code. 

<b></b>Ideally, all your code should look as if only one programmer wrote it. Then, it will be easy 

for other team members, especially new ones,

to read and understand it. </p><p><b>Code style conventions</b> partially help us to standardize and support well-readable code. These conventions are more like recommendations than strict rules. If a programmer follows them, his code will be more clean and consistent. <br></p><p>Kotlin has its own conventions, which can be found <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html">here</a>. We will follow them in all our examples and exercises. We recommend you do the same. Do not try to learn all the conventions at once; just open them from time to time after learning some new concepts. We will also give parts of these conventions in this course.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Follow your first conventions</h2><p>Let's learn a few code conventions for Kotlin.</p><ol><li><b>It is recommended to use 4 spaces for indentation instead of tabs.</b></li><li><b>In many cases, semicolons (<code>;</code>) are optional, so omit them wherever possible.</b></li><li><b>Put the opening curly brace at the end of the line where the block begins, and the closing brace at the start of a separate line.</b></li></ol><p>As an example, the program bellow follows both conventions</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) { // opening curly brace
    println("Hello, World!") // this statement is offset by 4 spaces and has no ; at the end
} // closing brace</code></pre><p>Congratulations, you are already following the conventions! Continue in the same way to always write wonderful code. And remember: <i>good code is like a good joke: it needs no explanation</i>.<br></p>
