<p>We hope you have already learned how to write simple Python programs consisting of a single line that just prints a text. However, real programs contain a significant number of lines: from tens and hundreds for small scripts to thousands and even more for large projects. So, in this lesson, you will write programs that print multiple lines.</p>

<p>Let's consider an example, the following code prints exactly three strings, each from a new line:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print("I")
print("know")
print("Python")</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">I
know
Python</code></pre>

<p>You can run this example <a href="https://trinket.io/python/1fcafce1ca" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://trinket.io/python/1fcafce1ca">here</a> or locally if you have already installed Python on your computer.</p>

<p>There are other ways to print the same text using just one function call. We will consider them in the next topics.</p>

<p>The <code>print</code> function also allows you to print an empty line with no string specified:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print("I")
print()
print("know")
print()
print("Python")</code></pre>

<p>Here's the output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">I

know

Python</code></pre>

<p>Now it's time to solve some problems.</p>
