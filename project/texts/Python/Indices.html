<p>Since lists are ordered collections, each element has an index that corresponds to its position in the list. So, elements can be accessed by that index at any time.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Indices of elements</h2>

<p>To access an element of a list by its index, you need to use the <strong>square brackets. </strong>You add the brackets after your list, and inside them you write the index of the element you're accessing.</p>

<p><strong>Important,</strong> that the indices start with 0, so the first element has the index of 0. The last element has the index of <code>len(list) - 1</code>.</p>

<p>Here is an example.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

first_elem = colors[0]   # 'red'
second_elem = colors[1]  # 'green'
third_elem = colors[2]   # 'blue'</code></pre>

<p>When using indices, it's important to stay within the range of your list: you'll get an error (called <code>IndexError</code>) if you try to access an element with a non-existing index!</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
print(colors[3])  # IndexError: list index out of range</code></pre>

<p>After some practice, you will not encounter such errors.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Accessing elements of nested lists</h2>

<p>If a list has a nested list, elements of this nested list can be also accessed by indices.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, [2, 3], 4]
nested_numbers = numbers[1]

print(nested_numbers)  # [2, 3]
print(nested_numbers[1])  # 3</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we obtain the second element of <code>numbers</code> by the index 1. This element is a nested list <code>[2, 3]</code>. Then we print the second element of <code>nested_numbers</code> by the index 1. This element is the number 3.</p>

<p>It is also possible to access an element of a nested list without an additional variable using a sequence of square brackets.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">lists = [0, [1, [2, 3]]]
print(lists[1][1][0])  # 2
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you've learned what lists are and how to create them, you can use them in situations when you need to store many elements in a particular order.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Negative indices</h2>

<p>To easily access the elements at the end of the list you can use <strong>negative indices</strong>: the minus before the number sort of changes your perspective and you look at the list from the end. So, the last element of the list, in this case, has an index equal <code>-1</code>, and the first element of the list has an index <code>-length of the list</code>.</p>

<p>Look at the examples below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

last_elem = colors[-1]    # 'blue'
second_elem = colors[-2]  # 'green'
first_elem = colors[-3]   # 'red'</code></pre>

<p>If you'll write a non-existing index, you'll also get <code>IndexError</code>.</p>

<p>The following picture shows the general concept of indices in a list.</p>

<p>We hope, you will not have problems with indices!</p>
