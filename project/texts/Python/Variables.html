<h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a variable?</h2>

<p>You can use a programming language like Python as a calculator or manipulate with constant values like strings. But to write full-featured programs you usually need to <strong>store values</strong> or evaluation results in the computer memory. </p>

<p><strong>Variable</strong> is a named place where you can put some value and retrive the value later. A variable can be perceived as a <em>box</em> where you keep something.</p>

<p>The concept of variables is useful when you calculate something and would like to reuse the formula for some other numbers. In this case, you operate only with these "boxes" and later you can provide some other objects putting them into the variable you use.</p>

<p>In general, it's a good practice to use a variable with a name that describes what does it store.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Defining a variable and assigning values</h2>

<p>You can keep almost anything in variables just assigning the new value for a named variable with an equal sign.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">day_of_week = "Monday"</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a string typed value <code>"Monday"</code> stored in computer memory. You can retrieve the value by calling the variable name.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(day_of_week)  # Monday</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>day_of_week</code> stores a value of the <code>str</code> type.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(type(day_of_week))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;</code></pre>

<p>You can always assign a new value to a defined variable:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">day_of_week = "Tuesday"</code></pre>

<p>Now, you will retrieve another value:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(day_of_week)  # Tuesday</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to assign the value of one variable to another variable:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">a = 10
b = a  # b is 10</code></pre>

<p>If a variable isn't defined in the scope of your code you'll see an error:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print(month_name)  # NameError: name 'month_name' is not defined</code></pre>

<p>Python allows you to assign values of different types to the same variable. Let's assign the string name of a month to a variable and print its type.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">month = "December"
print(type(month))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's assign the number of this month to the variable and print its type again.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">month = 12
print(type(month))  # &lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This works because Python is a language with <em>dynamic typing</em>. Please, do not to abuse it.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Naming rules</h2>

<p>As we mention above,  each variable has a specific name to distingush it from other variables. There are some rules for naming variables you must follow:</p>

<ul>
	<li>names are case-sensitive (<code>month</code> is not the same as <code>Month</code>);</li>
	<li>a name begins with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits, and underscores (e.g. <code>user_name</code>, <code>score1</code>, <code>_count</code>);</li>
	<li>name cannot start with a digit (e.g. <code>2q</code> is not a valid name);</li>
	<li>a name must not be a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">keyword</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>[ALERT-warning]<strong>Do not break these rules</strong>; otherwise, your program will not work.[/ALERT]</p>
